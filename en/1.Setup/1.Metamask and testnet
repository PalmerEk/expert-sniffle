## Get some testnet ETH

Head on over to the [goerli portal](https://goerli.portal.zksync.io/) and connect your wallet. Make sure your wallet is using the new zkSync Era testnet network you just added to Metamask.

This next step was a bit hard to discover _but_ in the bottom right corner of the portal there is a button that allows you to choose the network you want to connect to. Click on the dropdown and select the zkSync Era testnet network.

after that a button and menu item will appear for the faucet. It requires a twitter post to get the testnet ETH. I can't verify that is actually works as I havn't received any testnet ETH yet.
