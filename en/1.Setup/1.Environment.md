This is very much a work in progress, both the site and the lesson. The lesson is available on [github](https://github.com/PalmerEk/expert-sniffle) so feel free to make additions/changes. As for how... I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader but feel free to hit me up on discord.

## The bare necessities

I'm not going to go into detail here because it's pretty well documented elsewhere, but here's what you'll need to get started:

-   [node.js (via nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

-   [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/)
